# fake-imgix

Local development stand-in for Imgix. Don't use this as a base for some half-assed attempt at a production replacement for a image management service. You're going to have a bad time.

Intended to be used in conjunction with services like [FakeS3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3) and [FakeSQS](https://github.com/iain/fake_sqs).
